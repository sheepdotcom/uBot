# uBot

A simple bot to record and replay macros, but also comes with many advanced features (coming soon were still in beta)

Current Status: Working very accurately

TASing platformers is annoying currently because you cant buffer inputs in the pause menu yet.
Also buffering inputs before loading a checkpoint doesnt work yet.
