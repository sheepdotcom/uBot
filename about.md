# uBot

A simple bot to record and replay macros, but also comes with many advanced features (coming soon were still in beta)

Current Status: Working very accurately except for platformers in which it will most likely fail

TASing platformers is annoying currently because you cant buffer inputs in the pause menu yet.
Also buffering inputs before loading a checkpoint doesnt work yet.
