# uBot
This is where she makes a mod.

Originally called uwuBot but I changed it because some may find it wierd.
It's still called uwuBot in the code >w<
Also I love catgirls (I am wierd)

Currently in beta due to many features still to be added but the bot does work ~~perfectly~~.

# Planned Features

A list of features to remind me of what to add and maybe when.

Completed:
- Practice Bug Fix (Still being updated)
- Disable checkpoints (for platformer)

In Progress:

Not Started:
- Safe Mode (Probably within a few updates)
- Disable Inputs While Replaying (Sometime Soon)
- Frame Advance (Probably for v0.4.0-beta)
- Menu Redesign (Maybe before release)
- Show Hitboxes (Is this really needed?)
- Show Trajectory (Probably more useful than show hitboxes but would require custom hitboxes)
- Converting macros from one type to another (Unsure if I do this before release)
- Internal Recorder (After release?)
- Advanced Macro Editor (Too far in the future for me to worry about)
- Pathfinder (This ones gonna be hard)
